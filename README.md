# good_README_generator

## Description
    
This is a CLI application designed to assist in the generation of professional grade README.md files.
All you need to do once you install the application is open it via node and answer the questions
that it generates for you.  After that, you can add custom images to really bring the README to life, but
you will have an expertly formatted starting point to work off of.  

The application works by using the inquirer module installed via NPM to prompt the user for questions, and then
uses the answers to those questions to fill in the blanks on the template README.  
    
## Table of Contents

The table of Contents will allow the user to navigate through your README.md with ease, especially useful
if your README gets lengthy or contains many images that make it difficult to scroll through.

## Installation Instructions

To install this CLI application, you can clone it from this github respository so that you have it on your local device.
After that, you will need to use Node to run the index.js file on your local server so that the application
will be functional and you can answer the questions that will be populated onto your generated README.md.  
    
## Usage Information

The main use for this project is the generation of a professional README.md file with very little effort.  By running the 
program you are asked to fill in the details for each of the major sections of a well written README.md, thereby streamlining
the process and ensuring that you do not omit any important sections.

## Tests

The best way to test this program is to run it using Node: node index.js.  Once you answer all the questions, it will create a file
called exampleREADME.md which you can either push to github to see how it looks, or use a website such as [Stack Edit](https://stackedit.io/)
